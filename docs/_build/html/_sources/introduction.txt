Introduction
==============================================================================================

The Harman Kardon WirelessHD (or HKWirelessHD) SDK is provided for 3rd party developers to connect Harman/Kardon Omni and JBL Link Series audio devices. The intent of this SDK is to provide the APIs, tools and libraries needed for developers to build, test and deploy their wireless audio applications on your platform.

Currently, three kinds of APIs are provided by Harman Developer Program team.

- iOS APIs and SDK
- Android APIs and SDK
- Web (REST) APIs

This document describes only about the REST APIs, and for iOS and Android SDK, you can refer to `Harman developer website`_.
